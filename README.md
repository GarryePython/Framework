Archiving
After 14~15 years of development, the fRAMEWORK.NET project has finally been archived. I would like to send a big thank you to everyone who has ever comitted, dedicated, or otherwise devoted their time and effort into making this repository better every day. What had started as a project to store knowledge in the form of algorithms and implementations had grown way beyond my expectations since I first joined university and started working on research ~15 years ago.

In the meantime, many things have happened, and the ML landscape had also greatly evolved since then.

However, I pledge you to absolutely not interpret the archiving of this project as a loss. The main goal of this project since day 1 was to crystalize the ML knowledge available at the time in the form of source code and store it under a number of compatible free software licenses. As such, if you would like to, do not feel afraid of copy and pasting portions of this project into your own implementations. If I (Cesar De Souza) am the solely implementor of any of the classes you would like to port, I hereby grant you an irrevocable license to do so. If I am not, and the current license of the file you would like to port does not suit your needs, I can help you contact their original developers to help you with the transition.
